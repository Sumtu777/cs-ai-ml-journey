# 🚀 My CS + AI/ML Journey

Welcome to my self-structured Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) curriculum.

> 🧭 This is a 5-year, in-depth learning journey focused on mastery — not speed.

This repository documents every course, project, and reflection as I follow a path inspired by top global programs like MIT, Stanford, and DeepLearning.ai.

Rather than rushing through bootcamps or short courses, I’m building the depth, tools, and portfolio for me — fully self-taught and openly documented.

## 📚 Program Overview

This curriculum is designed to be equivalent to — and in many ways deeper than — a traditional university degree in CS with advanced specialization in AI and ML.

It draws from:
- 🎓 MIT OpenCourseWare (6.xxx Series)
- 🤖 DeepLearning.ai, fast.ai, and Stanford CS courses
- 🧠 Research-backed LLM & NLP engineering
- 🛠️ Tools used by industry professionals (TensorFlow, Git, SQL, etc.)

### 🧭 Structure

- **Duration**: 5 years (10 semesters, 2 per year)
- **Core Focus**:
  - Theoretical Computer Science & Math
  - Data Science, ML, and Deep Learning
  - LLM Engineering and Prompt Design
  - Tools, Reflections, Projects, and Real Use Cases

## 📓 Reflections

Each semester includes honest reflections:
- What I learned
- What challenged me
- How I improved
- What I’ll do better next

These reflections are available in the `/reflections/` folder and will also be published on my blog.

## 🌐 Showcase & Blog

Soon, this journey will be shared via:
- 📂 **Portfolio Website**
- ✍️ **Technical Blog**
- 🗃️ **Notion Dashboard (Public View)**
- 🔗 **LinkedIn Project Highlights**

Everything will be traceable from this GitHub repo.
